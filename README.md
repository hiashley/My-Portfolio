# My-Portfolio
This is my portfolio displaying my credentials and work.
- I created a portfolio using HTML and CSS.
- I added my own unique style to make a distinguishable portfolio. For instance, I added a custom font and spiced up the structure of the page creatively.
- The page includes a nav bar, header, about me section, work section, and contact me section.
- Project 2 and Project 3 links will not work because they are placeholders for future projects.
